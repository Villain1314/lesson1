  <h1>Segway'n USA</h1>

    Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!

  <h2>August 20,2012</h2>

  <p>well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
    through some interesting places in the way : Walla Walla, WA, magic City, ID,
    Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, Co,why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM.

  <p>
    I saw some Burme Shave style signs on the side of the
    road today:"passed cars, When you can't see, May get you,A glismpse,
    Of eternity." I definitely won't be passing any cars.

    <p>My frist day of the trip! I can't believe I fainlly got everything
      packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to
      bring a whole lot with me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>cell phone</li>
      <li>iPod</li>
      <li>digital camera</li>
      <li>and a protein bar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Just the essentials. AS Lao Tzu would have said,"A journey of a thousand miles begins
      with one Segway."</p>
